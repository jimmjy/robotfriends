This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a fun little react practice app I made.  I basically calls a list of users from a json file and assigns
the users a random robot image based of their id.  It puts cards to the display with the robot image, their name and email.
Though it is only 10 users, you can search for a user and while doing that, it will eliminate the none users from the display.

This app uses, api requests, conditional rendering and incorporates many components into the app to separate the concerns for each
component.

Project is now deploy on github pages and can be viewed at: https://jimmjy.github.io/robotfriends/
